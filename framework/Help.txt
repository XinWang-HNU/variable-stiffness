*For running the algorithm, one should first create a file in the following directory:
D:\optLaminatedComp
Then, copy and paste the containing files in the algorithm folder into this directory.

* The current algorithm ought to runs the verification case (L/R=2) with PSO algorithm. 

* Replace "pythonScript_Spline" with "pythonScript" in the following line of the file bucklingMoment,
in order to incorporate the ability to replace the spline fit of theta 
with linear: 
system(['abaqus cae nogui=pythonScript.py'])
